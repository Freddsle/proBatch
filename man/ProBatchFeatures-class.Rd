\title{ProBatchFeatures: QFeatures subclass with operation log, levels/pipelines, and lazy storage}
\description{
Assay naming convention:
  "<level>::<pipeline>"  e.g., "peptide::raw", "protein::median_on_log"
Pipelines are strings produced by get_chain(as_string=TRUE), e.g., "combat_on_medianNorm_on_log".
}
\details{
Ephemeral "fast" steps are computed but not stored by default (store_fast_steps = FALSE).
Use pb_eval() to compute and return data after a step/pipeline without storing.
Use pb_transform() to build pipelines and optionally materialize the final assay.
}

\item{\code{chain}}{character() ordered list of steps (e.g., c("log","medianNorm","combat")).}

\item{\code{oplog}}{S4Vectors::DataFrame with columns:
- step (character), fun (character), from (character), to (character),
params (list), timestamp (POSIXct), pkg (character)}
