correct_with_removeBatchEffect_df(
  df_long,
  sample_annotation = NULL,
  feature_id_col = "peptide_group_label",
  measure_col = "Intensity",
  sample_id_col = "FullRunName",

\arguments{
\item{df_long}{data frame where each row is a single feature in a single
sample. It minimally has a \code{sample_id_col}, a \code{feature_id_col}
and a \code{measure_col}, but usually also an \code{m_score} (in OpenSWATH
output result file). See \code{help("example_proteome")} for more details.}

\item{sample_annotation}{data frame with:
\enumerate{ \item \code{sample_id_col} (this can be repeated as row names)
  \item biological covariates
  \item technical covariates (batches etc) }.
  See \code{help("example_sample_annotation")}}

\item{feature_id_col}{name of the column with feature/gene/peptide/protein
ID used in the long format representation \code{df_long}. In the wide
formatted representation \code{data_matrix} this corresponds to the row
names.}

\item{measure_col}{if \code{df_long} is among the parameters, it is the
column with expression/abundance/intensity; otherwise, it is used
internally for consistency.}

\item{sample_id_col}{name of the column in \code{sample_annotation} table,
where the filenames (colnames of the \code{data_matrix} are found).}

\item{batch_col}{column in \code{sample_annotation} that should be used for
batch comparison (or other, non-batch factor to be mapped to color in plots).}

\item{covariates_cols}{Optional character vector of \code{sample_annotation} columns
included in \code{mod} for ComBat (biological or nuisance covariates).}

\item{fill_the_missing}{Missing-value policy applied \emph{before} discrete correction.
If \code{NULL} (default), missing values are left as is (no imputation/dropping).
For \code{ComBat}, the matrix must be NA-free â€” set \code{FALSE} to drop rows with NA
or provide a numeric value to impute. For \code{removeBatchEffect}, NA values in the data
matrix are permitted; however, the design (batch/covariates) must not contain NA.}

\item{keep_all}{when transforming the data (normalize, correct) - acceptable
values: all/default/minimal (which set of columns be kept).}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to \code{adjust_batch_trend_df()} and
the chosen \code{fit_func}.}
