\arguments{
\item{data_matrix}{features (in rows) vs samples (in columns) matrix, with
feature IDs in rownames and file/sample names as colnames.
See "example_proteome_matrix" for more details (to call the description,
use \code{help("example_proteome_matrix")})}

\item{sample_annotation}{data frame with:
\enumerate{ \item \code{sample_id_col} (this can be repeated as row names)
  \item biological covariates
  \item technical covariates (batches etc) }.
  See \code{help("example_sample_annotation")}}

\item{continuous_func}{e.g. \code{"loess_regression"} or \code{NULL}.}

\item{discrete_func}{batch method name.}

\item{batch_col}{column in \code{sample_annotation} that should be used for
batch comparison (or other, non-batch factor to be mapped to color in plots).}

\item{feature_id_col}{name of the column with feature/gene/peptide/protein
ID used in the long format representation \code{df_long}. In the wide
formatted representation \code{data_matrix} this corresponds to the row
names.}

\item{sample_id_col}{name of the column in \code{sample_annotation} table,
where the filenames (colnames of the \code{data_matrix} are found).}

\item{measure_col}{if \code{df_long} is among the parameters, it is the
column with expression/abundance/intensity; otherwise, it is used
internally for consistency.}

\item{order_col}{column in \code{sample_annotation} that determines sample
order. It is used for in initial assessment plots
(\link{plot_sample_mean_or_boxplot}) and  feature-level diagnostics
(\link{feature_level_diagnostics}). Can be `NULL`
   if sample order is irrelevant (e.g. in genomic experiments). For more
   details,
   order definition/inference, see \link{define_sample_order} and
   \link{date_to_sample_order}}

\item{min_measurements}{Minimum number of samples per batch required for fitting.}

\item{no_fit_imputed}{(logical) whether to use imputed (requant) values, as flagged in
\code{qual_col} by \code{qual_value} for data transformation}

\item{fill_the_missing}{Missing-value policy applied \emph{before} discrete correction.
If \code{NULL} (default), missing values are left as is (no imputation/dropping).
For \code{ComBat}, the matrix must be NA-free â€” set \code{FALSE} to drop rows with NA
or provide a numeric value to impute. For \code{removeBatchEffect}, NA values in the data
matrix are permitted; however, the design (batch/covariates) must not contain NA.}

\item{par.prior}{Logical; use parametric prior (ComBat) or non-parametric.}

\item{covariates_cols}{Optional character vector of \code{sample_annotation} columns
included in \code{mod} for ComBat (biological or nuisance covariates).}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to \code{adjust_batch_trend_df()} and
the chosen \code{fit_func}.}
