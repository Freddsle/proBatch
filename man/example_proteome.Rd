\title{Example protein data in long format}
\format{
A data frame with 124655 rows and 7 variables:
\describe{
  \item{peptide_group_label}{peptide ID, which is regular feature level.
  This column is mostly used as \code{feature_id_col}} used for merging with
  \code{"example_peptide_annotation"}
  \item{Intensity}{peptide group intensity in given sample.
  Used in function as \code{measure_col}}
  \item{Protein}{Protein group ID, specified as
  N/UniProtID1|UniProtID2|...,
  where N is number of protein peptide group maps to. If
  1/UniProtID, then this is proteotypic peptide, in functions used as
  \code{protein_col}}
  \item{FullRunName}{name of the file, in most functions used for
  \code{sample_id_col}}
  \item{m_score}{column marking the quality of peptide IDs, used as
  \code{qual_col} throughout the script; when \code{qual_value} is 2 in this
  column, peptide has been imputed (requantified)}
...

PRIDE ID will be added upon the publication of the dataset

\description{
This is OpenSWATH-output data from Aging study with all iRT, spike-in peptides,
few representative peptides and proteins for signal improvement demonstration.
Using \code{matrix_to_long} can be converted to \code{example_proteome_matrix}
